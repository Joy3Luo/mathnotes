## <font color= 977FD7> Lesson 1 - Hello Python </font>

This course covers the key Python skills you’ll need so you can start using Python for data science.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Hello, Python! </font>

Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python, so we'll make our first Python program a homage to their skit about Spam.

```python
spam_amount = 0
print(spam_amount)

# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4

if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)

------------------
OUTPUT:
0
But I don't want ANY spam!
Spam Spam Spam Spam
```

There's a lot to unpack here! This silly program demonstrates many important aspects of what Python code looks like and how it works. Let's review the code from top to bottom.

```python
spam_amount = 0
```
**Variable assignment**: Here we create a variable called spam_amount and assign it the value of 0 using =, which is called the assignment operator.

> **Aside**: If you've programmed in certain other languages (like Java or C++), you might be noticing some things Python doesn't require us to do here:
>> * we don't need to "declare" spam_amount before assigning to it
>> * we don't need to tell Python what type of value spam_amount is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam_amount to refer to a different sort of thing like a string or a boolean.

```python
print(spam_amount)

------------------
OUTPUT:
0
```
**Function calls**:. print is a Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, and putting the inputs (or arguments) to the function in those parentheses.

```python
# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4
```
The first line above is a **comment**. In Python, comments begin with the # symbol.

Next we see an example of reassignment. Reassigning the value of an existing variable looks just the same as creating a variable - it still uses the = assignment operator.

In this case, the value we're assigning to spam_amount involves some simple arithmetic on its previous value. When it encounters this line, Python evaluates the expression on the right-hand-side of the = (0 + 4 = 4), and then assigns that value to the variable on the left-hand-side.

```python
if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam Spam Spam"
print(viking_song)

------------------
OUTPUT:
But I don't want ANY spam!
Spam Spam Spam
```

We won't talk much about "conditionals" until later, but, even if you've never coded before, you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity.

Note how we indicated which code belongs to the ```if```. ```"But I don't want ANY spam!"``` is only supposed to be printed if ```spam_amount``` is positive. But the later code (like ```print(viking_song)```) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?

The colon (```:```) at the end of the if line indicates that a new code block is starting. Subsequent lines which are indented are part of that code block.

>**Aside**: If you've coded before, you might know that some other languages use ```{```curly braces```}``` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace can be surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks.

The later lines dealing with ```viking_song``` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the ```if```'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we define functions and using loops.

This code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:

```python
"But I don't want ANY spam!"
```

Strings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string contains a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we're careful.)

```python
viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)

------------------
OUTPUT:
Spam Spam Spam Spam
```

The ```*``` operator can be used to multiply two numbers (```3 * 3``` evaluates to 9), but we can also multiply a string by a number, to get a version that's been repeated that many times. Python offers a number of cheeky little time-saving tricks like this where operators like ```*``` and ```+``` have a different meaning depending on what kind of thing they're applied to. (The technical term for this is operator overloading.)

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Numbers and arithmetic in Python </font>

We've already seen an example of a variable containing a number above:

```python
spam_amount = 0
```
"Number" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that ```spam_amount``` is:


```python
type(spam_amount)

------------------
OUTPUT:
int
```
It's an ```int``` - short for integer. There's another sort of number we commonly encounter in Python:

```python
type(19.95)

------------------
OUTPUT:
float
```
A ```float``` is a number with a decimal place - very useful for representing things like weights or proportions.

type() is the second built-in function we've seen (after ```print()```), and it's another good one to remember. It's very useful to be able to ask Python "what kind of thing is this?".


A natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic. We've seen the ```+``` operator for addition, and the ```*``` operator for multiplication. Python also has us covered for the rest of the basic buttons on your calculator:

```python
Operator	Name		Description
a + b		Addition	Sum of a and b
a - b		Subtraction	Difference of a and b
a * b		Multiplication	Product of a and b
a / b		True division	Quotient of a and b
a // b		Floor division	Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts
a % b		Modulus	Integer remainder after division of a by b
a ** b		Exponentiation	a raised to the power of b
-a		Negation	The negative of a
```

One interesting observation here is that, whereas your calculator probably just has one button for division, Python can do two kinds. "True division" is basically what your calculator does:

```python
print(5 / 2)
print(6 / 2)

------------------
OUTPUT:
2.5
3.0
```

It always gives us a ```float```.

The ```//``` operator gives us a result that's rounded down to the next integer.

```python
print(5 // 2)
print(6 // 2)

------------------
OUTPUT:
2
3
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Order of operations </font>

The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. Some remember these by a mnemonic such as PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

Python follows similar rules about which calculations to perform first. They're mostly pretty intuitive.

```python
8 - 3 + 2

------------------
OUTPUT:
7
```

```python
-3 + 4 * 2
------------------
OUTPUT:
5
```

Sometimes the default order of operations isn't what we want:

```python
hat_height_cm = 25
my_height_cm = 190
# How tall am I, in meters, when wearing my hat?
total_height_meters = hat_height_cm + my_height_cm / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters, "?")
------------------
OUTPUT:
Height in meters = 26.9 ?
```

Parentheses are useful here. You can add them to force Python to evaluate sub-expressions in whatever order you want.

```python
total_height_meters = (hat_height_cm + my_height_cm) / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Height in meters = 2.15
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Builtin functions for working with numbers </font>

min and max return the minimum and maximum of their arguments, respectively...

```python
print(min(1, 2, 3))
print(max(1, 2, 3))
------------------
OUTPUT:
1
3
```

abs returns the absolute value of an argument:

```python
print(abs(32))
print(abs(-32))
------------------
OUTPUT:
32
32
```

In addition to being the names of Python's two main numerical types, int and float can also be called as functions which convert their arguments to the corresponding type:

```python
print(float(10))
print(int(3.33))
# They can even be called on strings!
print(int('807') + 1)
------------------
OUTPUT:
10.0
3
808
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Exercise: Syntax, Variables, and Numbers </font>

```python
pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter/2
____

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * radius**2
```

```python
########### Setup code - don't touch this part ######################
# If you're curious, these are examples of lists. We'll talk about
# them in depth a few lessons from now. For now, just know that they're
# yet another type of Python object, like int or float.
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]
q2.store_original_ids()
######################################################################

# Your code goes here. Swap the values to which a and b refer.
# If you get stuck, you can always uncomment one or both of the lines in
# the next cell for a hint, or to peek at the solution.

c = a
a = b
b = c

Correct:

# The most straightforward solution is to use a third variable
# to temporarily store one of the old values. e.g.:
#
# tmp = a
# a = b
# b = tmp
# If you've read lots of Python code, you might have seen the
# following trick to swap two variables in one line:

# a, b = b, a
# We'll demystify this bit of Python magic later when we talk about tuples.
```


```python
# Alice, Bob and Carol have agreed to pool their Halloween candy
# and split it evenly among themselves. For the sake of their
# friendship, any candies left over will be smashed. For example,
# if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30
# each and smash 1.

# Write an arithmetic expression below to calculate how many candies
# they must smash for a given haul.

# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109

# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies

to_smash = (alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies) % 3
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Lesson 2 - Functions and Getting Help </font>

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Getting Help </font>

You saw the abs function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?

The help() function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. If you can remember how to use help(), you hold the key to understanding most other functions.

Here is an example:

```python
help(round)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on built-in function round in module builtins:

round(number, ndigits=None)
    Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.

    The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.  Otherwise
    the return value has the same type as the number.  ndigits may be negative.
```
help() displays two things:

1. the header of that function round(number, ndigits=None). In this case, this tells us that round() takes an argument we can describe as number. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as ndigits.
2. A brief English description of what the function does.

**Common pitfall**: when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function.

What happens if we invoke help on a call to the function round()? Unhide the output of the cell below to see.

```python
help(round(-2.01))

Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of round(-2.01), then it provides help on the output of that expression.

(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the help output above will make more sense.)

round is a very simple function with a short docstring. help shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like print. Don't worry if the following output looks inscrutable... for now, just see if you can pick anything new out from this help.

```python
help(print)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
    Optional keyword arguments:
    file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
    sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
    end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
    flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
```

If you were looking for it, you might learn that print can take an argument called sep, and that this describes what we put between all the other arguments when we print them.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Defining functions </font>

Builtin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.

```python
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
```

This creates a function called ```least_difference```, which takes three arguments, ```a```, ```b```, and ```c```.

Functions start with a header introduced by the ```def``` keyword. The indented block of code following the ```:``` is run when the function is called.

return is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a ```return``` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.

Is it clear what ```least_difference()``` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:


```python
print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7), # Python allows trailing commas in argument lists. How nice is that?
    )
------------------
OUTPUT:
9 0 1
```

Or maybe the ```help()``` function can tell us something about it.

```python
help(least_difference)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on function least_difference in module __main__:

least_difference(a, b, c)
```

Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.

**Docstrings**

```python
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.

    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
```

The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call help() on a function, it shows the docstring.

```python
help(least_difference)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Help on function least_difference in module __main__:

least_difference(a, b, c)
    Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.

    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4

```

>**Aside**: The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The >>> is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example, see this docstring for the numpy function np.eye.

Good programmers use docstrings unless they expect to throw away the code soon after it's used (which is rare). So, you should start writing docstrings, too!


#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Functions that don't return </font>

What would happen if we didn't include the return keyword in our function?

```python
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    min(diff1, diff2, diff3)

print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7),
    )
------------------
OUTPUT:
None None None
```

Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value None. (This is similar to the concept of "null" in other languages.)

Without a return statement, least_difference is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: print() and help() don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.

```python
mystery = print()
print(mystery)
------------------
OUTPUT:
None
```

**Default arguments**

When we called help(print), we saw that the print function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for sep to put some special string in between our printed arguments:

```python
print(1, 2, 3, sep=' < ')
------------------
OUTPUT:
1 < 2 < 3
```

But if we don't specify a value, sep is treated as having a default value of ```' '``` (a single space).

```python
print(1, 2, 3)
------------------
OUTPUT:
1 2 3
```

Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:

```python
def greet(who="Colin"):
    print("Hello,", who)

greet()
greet(who="Kaggle")
# (In this case, we don't need to specify the name of the argument, because it's unambiguous.)
greet("world")
------------------
OUTPUT:
Hello, Colin
Hello, Kaggle
Hello, world
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Functions Applied to Functions </font>

Here's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first. You can supply functions as arguments to other functions. Some example may make this clearer:

```python
def mult_by_five(x):
    return 5 * x

def call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on arg"""
    return fn(arg)

def squared_call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on the result of calling fn on arg"""
    return fn(fn(arg))

print(
    call(mult_by_five, 1),
    squared_call(mult_by_five, 1),
    sep='\n', # '\n' is the newline character - it starts a new line
    )
------------------
OUTPUT:
5
25
```

Functions that operate on other functions are called "higher-order functions." You probably won't write your own for a little while. But there are higher-order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call.

Here's an interesting example using the ```max``` function.

By default, ```max``` returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional ```key``` argument, it returns the argument ```x``` that maximizes ```key(x)``` (aka the 'argmax').

```python
def mod_5(x):
    """Return the remainder of x after dividing by 5"""
    return x % 5

print(
    'Which number is biggest?',
    max(100, 51, 14),
    'Which number is the biggest modulo 5?',
    max(100, 51, 14, key=mod_5),
    sep='\n',
)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Which number is biggest?
100
Which number is the biggest modulo 5?
14
```

# Below is a simple function that will calculate the number of

# Modify it so that it optionally takes a second argument representing

# second argument is provided, it should assume 3 friends, as before.

def to_smash(total_candies, num_friends = 3):
    """Return the number of leftover candies that must be smashed after distributing

    return total_candies % num_friends
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Lesson 3 - Booleans and Conditionals </font>

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Booleans </font>

Python has a type of variable called bool. It has two possible values: True and False.

```python
x = True
print(x)
print(type(x))
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
<class 'bool'>
```

Rather than putting True or False directly in our code, we usually get boolean values from boolean operators. These are operators that answer yes/no questions. We'll go through some of these operators below.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Comparison Operations </font>

```python
Operation     	Description		
a == b	        a equal to b
a != b	        a not equal to b
a < b	        a less than b
a > b	        a greater than b
a <= b	        a less than or equal to b
a >= b	        a greater than or equal to b
```

```python
def can_run_for_president(age):
    """Can someone of the given age run for president in the US?"""
    # The US Constitution says you must be at least 35 years old
    return age >= 35

print("Can a 19-year-old run for president?", can_run_for_president(19))
print("Can a 45-year-old run for president?", can_run_for_president(45))
------------------
OUTPUT:
Can a 19-year-old run for president? False
Can a 45-year-old run for president? True
```

Comparisons frequently work like you'd hope

```python
3.0 == 3
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

But sometimes they can be tricky

```python
'3' == 3
------------------
OUTPUT:
False
```

Comparison operators can be combined with the arithmetic operators we've already seen to express a virtually limitless range of mathematical tests. For example, we can check if a number is odd by checking that the modulus with 2 returns 1:

```python
def is_odd(n):
    return (n % 2) == 1

print("Is 100 odd?", is_odd(100))
print("Is -1 odd?", is_odd(-1))
------------------
OUTPUT:
Is 100 odd? False
Is -1 odd? True
```

Remember to use == instead of = when making comparisons. If you write n == 2 you are asking about the value of n. When you write n = 2 you are changing the value of n.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Combining Boolean Values </font>

You can combine boolean values using the standard concepts of "and", "or", and "not". In fact, the words to do this are: and, or, and not.

With these, we can make our can_run_for_president function more accurate.

```python
def can_run_for_president(age, is_natural_born_citizen):
    """Can someone of the given age and citizenship status run for president in the US?"""
    # The US Constitution says you must be a natural born citizen *and* at least 35 years old
    return is_natural_born_citizen and (age >= 35)

print(can_run_for_president(19, True))
print(can_run_for_president(55, False))
print(can_run_for_president(55, True))
------------------
OUTPUT:
False
False
True
```

Quick, can you guess the value of this expression?

```python
True or True and False
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

To answer this, you'd need to figure out the order of operations.

For example, and is evaluated before or. That's why the first expression above is True. If we evaluated it from left to right, we would have calculated True or True first (which is True), and then taken the and of that result with False, giving a final value of False.

consider the following expression:

```python
prepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or rain_level < 5 and have_hood or not rain_level > 0 and is_workday
```

I'm trying to say that I'm safe from today's weather....

* if I have an umbrella...
* or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...
* otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining and it's a workday

But not only is my Python code hard to read, it has a bug. We can address both problems by adding some parentheses:

```python
prepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or (rain_level < 5 and have_hood) or not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday)
```

You can add even more parentheses if you think it helps readability:

```python
prepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))
```

We can also split it over multiple lines to emphasize the 3-part structure described above:

```python
prepared_for_weather = (
    have_umbrella
    or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood)
    or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))
)
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Conditionals </font>

Booleans are most useful when combined with conditional statements, using the keywords if, elif, and else.

Conditional statements, often referred to as if-then statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition. Here's an example:

```python
def inspect(x):
    if x == 0:
        print(x, "is zero")
    elif x > 0:
        print(x, "is positive")
    elif x < 0:
        print(x, "is negative")
    else:
        print(x, "is unlike anything I've ever seen...")

inspect(0)
inspect(-15)
------------------
OUTPUT:
0 is zero
-15 is negative
```

The if and else keywords are often used in other languages; its more unique keyword is elif, a contraction of "else if". In these conditional clauses, elif and else blocks are optional; additionally, you can include as many elif statements as you would like.

Note especially the use of colons (:) and whitespace to denote separate blocks of code. This is similar to what happens when we define a function - the function header ends with :, and the following line is indented with 4 spaces. All subsequent indented lines belong to the body of the function, until we encounter an unindented line, ending the function definition.

```python
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        print("Only printed when x is positive; x =", x)
        print("Also only printed when x is positive; x =", x)
    print("Always printed, regardless of x's value; x =", x)

f(1)
f(0)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Only printed when x is positive; x = 1
Also only printed when x is positive; x = 1
Always printed, regardless of x's value; x = 1
Always printed, regardless of x's value; x = 0
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Boolean conversion </font>

We've seen int(), which turns things into ints, and float(), which turns things into floats, so you might not be surprised to hear that Python has a bool() function which turns things into bools.

```python
print(bool(1)) # all numbers are treated as true, except 0
print(bool(0))
print(bool("asf")) # all strings are treated as true, except the empty string ""
print(bool(""))
# Generally empty sequences (strings, lists, and other types we've yet to see like lists and tuples)
# are "falsey" and the rest are "truthy"
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
False
True
False
```

We can use non-boolean objects in if conditions and other places where a boolean would be expected. Python will implicitly treat them as their corresponding boolean value:

```python
if 0:
    print(0)
elif "spam":
    print("spam")
------------------
OUTPUT:
spam
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Exercise: Booleans and Conditionals </font>

```python
# Many programming languages have sign available as a built-in function.

# and 0 if it's 0.

# Your code goes here. Define a function called 'sign'

    if num == 0:
        return 0
    elif num < 0:
        return -1
    elif num > 0:
        return 1
```

    1
    """
    print("Splitting", total_candies, "candies")
    return total_candies % 3

to_smash(91)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Splitting 91 candies
1
------------------

# What happens if we call it with total_candies = 1?

to_smash(1)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Splitting 1 candies
1
------------------

# That isn't great grammar!

# Modify the definition in the cell below to correct the grammar of
# our print statement. (If there's only one candy, we should use
# the singular "candy" instead of the plural "candies")

def to_smash(total_candies):
    """Return the number of leftover candies that must be smashed after distributing
    the given number of candies evenly between 3 friends.

    >>> to_smash(91)
    1
    """
    if total_candies == 1:
        print("Splitting 1 candy")
    else:
        print("Splitting", total_candies, "candies")
        return total_candies % 3

    # OR

def onionless(ketchup, mustard, onion):
    """Return whether the customer doesn't want onions.
    """
    return not onion

def wants_all_toppings(ketchup, mustard, onion):
    """Return whether the customer wants "the works" (all 3 toppings)

```

## <font color= 977FD7> Lesson 4 - Lists </font>

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Lists </font>

Lists in Python represent ordered sequences of values. Here is an example of how to create them:

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

We can put other types of things in lists:

```python
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```
We can even make a list of lists:

```python
hands = [
    ['J', 'Q', 'K'],
    ['2', '2', '2'],
    ['6', 'A', 'K'], # (Comma after the last element is optional)
]
# (I could also have written this on one line, but it can get hard to read)
hands = [['J', 'Q', 'K'], ['2', '2', '2'], ['6', 'A', 'K']]
```

A list can contain a mix of different types of variables:

```python
my_favourite_things = [32, 'raindrops on roses', help]
# (Yes, Python's help function is *definitely* one of my favourite things)
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Indexing </font>

You can access individual list elements with square brackets.

Which planet is closest to the sun? Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has index 0.

```python
planets[0]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Mercury'
```

What's the next closest planet?

```python
planets[1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Venus'
```

Which planet is furthest from the sun?

Elements at the end of the list can be accessed with negative numbers, starting from -1:

```python
planets[-1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Neptune'
```

```python
planets[-2]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Uranus'
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Slicing </font>

What are the first three planets? We can answer this question using slicing:

```python
planets[0:3]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']
```

planets[0:3] is our way of asking for the elements of planets starting from index 0 and continuing up to but not including index 3.

The starting and ending indices are both optional. If I leave out the start index, it's assumed to be 0. So I could rewrite the expression above as:

```python
planets[:3]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']
```

If I leave out the end index, it's assumed to be the length of the list.

```python
planets[3:]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```

i.e. the expression above means "give me all the planets from index 3 onward".

We can also use negative indices when slicing:

```python
# All the planets except the first and last
planets[1:-1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus']
```

```python
# The last 3 planets
planets[-3:]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Changing lists </font>

Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".

One way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.

For example, let's say we want to rename Mars:

```python
planets[3] = 'Malacandra'
planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury',
 'Venus',
 'Earth',
 'Malacandra',
 'Jupiter',
 'Saturn',
 'Uranus',
 'Neptune']
```

Hm, that's quite a mouthful. Let's compensate by shortening the names of the first 3 planets.

```python
planets[:3] = ['Mur', 'Vee', 'Ur']
print(planets)
# That was silly. Let's give them back their old names
planets[:4] = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars',]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mur', 'Vee', 'Ur', 'Malacandra', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> List functions </font>

Python has several useful functions for working with lists.

len gives the length of a list:

```python
# How many planets are there?
len(planets)
------------------
OUTPUT:
8
```

sorted returns a sorted version of a list:

```python
# The planets sorted in alphabetical order
sorted(planets)
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Mars', 'Mercury', 'Neptune', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Venus']
```

sum does what you might expect:

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
sum(primes)
------------------
OUTPUT:
17
```
